// Package gg contains the gg command.
//
// The gg dependency management tool is a suite of commands built on the
// premise that the data in the glide.lock and Gopkg.lock formats, in
// combination with the metadata in git repositories, is sufficient to create a
// deterministic total order for all of a project's dependencies.
// With git, that total order, and insights from vgo's dependency resolver,
// which only takes into account the exact versions in a projects' transitive
// dependency's lockfiles, we can greatly improve the speed and predictability
// of common dependency management tasks.
//
// We can also provide a richer experience for dependency management that
// provides tools for introspecting a dependency solution and alternatives,
// heuristics for adding missing modules, pruning extra modules, and upgrading
// known dependencies.
//
// Lockfiles address git revisions with their commit or tag hash.
// From that hash we can infer a commit timestamp, a branch name or version by
// a reverse-lookup of known references in the package's git repository, and
// even read its entire import graph.  We can also read its own lockfiles and
// changelog.  From this we can generate a richer lockfile that caches all
// of this metadata and load it all very quickly for later dependency
// management tasks.
